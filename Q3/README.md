# Question 3: A workflow that upload the artifacts.

The workflow script for this question is intended to be stored in the `.github/workflows` of the repository.

I configured retention period of the artifacts produced by the building process to be 7 days.

Answers for Q2 and Q3 will be used and store in the `.github/workflows` as _helloworld_ci_workflow.yaml_ while the basic application with a hello world page locates at `./Q2`
